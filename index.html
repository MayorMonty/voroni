        <p>
          So what is a Voronoi Diagram exactly? Imagine we a number of random
          points in space (these points are usually called the <em>sites</em> of
          the diagram). The goal is to divide space into regions—one for each
          site—such that
          <em
            >each point in that region is closer to its specific site than any
            other site.</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          You can see an example of what exactly this means below. Move your
          cursor (or finger) over the region below to see what the closest site
          is at that point. See if you can find the areas where the closest site
          changes
        </p>

      <canvas id="demo-1" height="900" width="1600"></canvas>
      <section class="controls">
        <div class="control">
          <label>
            <span>Number of Points</span>
            <input
              type="number"
              min="2"
              max="12"
              step="1"
              value="4"
              id="demo-1-points"
            />
          </label>

      </section>

      <p>
        If you trace the graph long enough, you may be able to work out where
        some of the edges of the Voronoi Diagram are. But how could we create a
        more systematic approach to this?
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">Approach #1: Naive</h2>
      <section class="dashed-top" id="naive">
        <a href="#naive" class="permalink">#</a>
        <p>
          Let's start with the simplest way to do create voronoi regions. For every pixel on the
          canvas, just manually find the closest site, and color it appropriately.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="mono">
          <p class="line i0">let shortest = map(point => site)</p>
          <p class="line i0">for each point in plane {</p>
          <p class="line i1">let closest_site;</p>
          <p class="line i1">let closest_distance;</p>
          <p class="line i1">for each site in sites {</p>
          <p class="line i2">let distance = distance(point, site);</p>
          <p class="line i2">if distance < closest_distance {</p>
          <p class="line i3">closest_site = site;</p>
          <p class="line i3">closest_distance = distance;</p>
          <p class="line i2">}</p>
          <p class="line i1">}</p>
          <p class="line i1">shortest[point] = closest_site</p>
          <p class="line i0">}</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          So, let's try it! The demo below will find the nearest site for all pixels on a 320x180 canvas.
        </p>

        <canvas id="demo-2" height="180" width="320"></canvas>
        <section class="controls">
          <div class="control">
            <label>
              <span>Number of Points</span>
              <input
                type="number"
                min="2"
                max="9"
                step="1"
                value="4"
                id="demo-2-points"
              />
            </label>
          </div>
          <button id="demo-2-go" class="outlined">Go!</button>
        </section>

        <p>This method actually does have a few advantages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After the process is complete, we have a lookup table of pixel to
            site, which means that we don't need to do any further computation to render
          </li>
          <li>Relatively simple to understand and implement</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          However, the disadvantages to this approach make it nonviable for anything beyond very
          simple examples.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            It's so slow! Even though the canvas here is 25x smaller than the one above, it still
            takes a significant amount of time to process on modern hardware. This is because the
            algorithm is dependant on both the number of pixels and the number of sites. Increasing
            either of these will require more computation.
          </li>
          <li>
            We don't have any information about how these voronoi regions are
            shaped, all we have is a list of pixels. This is great for rendering
            like above, but makes working with the data beyond that very
            difficult
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Obviously, this sort of approach isn't going to work. Let's try to simply the problem
          a bit to see if we can get some ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine that we have only 2 points, say site A and site B. We're
          trying to draw a line that will divide the plane, such that all of
          the points on 1 side are the points that are closest to site A,
          and all of the points on the other are closest to site B.
        </p>

        <section class="image centered big">
          <img src="./assets/2_points.png" alt="2 points are on a graph" />
        </section>

        <p>
          For this case, where A and B have the same y-coordinate, we should
          just be able to draw a straight, vertical line halfway between the
          sites.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the line rests halfway between the two points, all of the
          points on the left side will be closer to site A, and all of the
          points on the right side will be closer to site B.
        </p>
        <section class="image centered big">
          <img src="./assets/bisector.png" alt="A vertical line divides " />
        </section>

        <p>
          For lines that do not have the same y-coordinate, we can just rotate
          the image, and use the <em>perpendicular bisector</em>. That is, the
          line that is perpendicular to the line that connects the two points, which passes through
          the midpoint of that line.
        </p>
        <section class="image centered big">
          <img
            src="./assets/perpendicular_bisector.png"
            alt="Use a perpendicular bisector to divide
          the two points"
          />
        </section>

        <p>
          So this is great! For any 2 points, we know how to draw a line that
          divides the plane correctly!
        </p>

        <p>
          For sites a and b, we can find the perpendicular bisector, or the
          equation of the voronoi edge like so:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Find the midpoint
            <p>\(M = (\frac{a_x + b_x}{2}, \frac{a_y + b_y}{2})\)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Find the slope of the line joining A and B:
            <p>\(m = \frac{a_y - b_y}{a_x - b_x}\)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            The perpendicular bisector is the line passing through the midpoint
            with the negative reciprocal of \(m\)
            <p>\(y - M_y = -\frac{1}{m}(x - M_x)\)</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          But what about graphs with more than two points? Well,
          let's try it! The demo below shows all the perpendicular bisectors
          between all of the points on the graph
        </p>

        <canvas id="demo-3" height="900" width="1600"></canvas>
        <section class="controls">
          <div class="control">
            <label>
              <span>Number of Points</span>
              <input
                type="number"
                min="2"
                max="12"
                step="1"
                value="4"
                id="demo-3-points"
              />
            </label>
          </div>
          <button id="demo-3-go" class="outlined">Go</button>
        </section>
      </section>

      <p>Where these lines intersect is where we run into problems. We really only want to show a
      <em>portion</em> of each bisector, some range of x-values where it is valid.</p>

      <p>So how do we determine that range?</p>
